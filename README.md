# Data Visualization: Income, Poverty, and Unemployment Patterns

## Overview

This project uses interactive Tableau visualizations to explore how median household income and poverty levels relate to unemployment across U.S. states.

Through a series of scatter plots and a geographic dashboard, the visuals reveal consistent patterns showing that higher income levels are generally associated with lower unemployment, while higher poverty rates are associated with higher unemployment. The project highlights key outliers, regional patterns, and income-stratified comparisons that demonstrate unemployment outcomes are not evenly distributed, even among economically similar states.

The focus of this project is on effective visual encoding, dashboard interaction, and clear presentation of insight rather than complex statistical modeling.

## Key Insight

Income and poverty are strong indicators of unemployment patterns, but regional and structural differences between states show that income alone does not fully explain labor market outcomes.
